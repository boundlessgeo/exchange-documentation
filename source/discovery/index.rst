There are many different ways to find, filter and display data throughout Exchange. Whether you know exactly what you’re looking for, or you only have a general idea, Exchange helps you find exactly what you need.

**Exchange Search** - You will find the :guilabel:`Search` field at the top of every Exchange page. When you type in the search field, Exchange will list the layers, maps, and documents matching the text you’ve entered. Select a resource in the list to open its information page. *Note: This is a simple search, and does not require wildcards or Boolean operators.*

**Browsing Layers** - Click on the Layers link on the Boundless Exchange toolbar to open the Layers page. Here you can browse data that has been uploaded into Exchange. From the layers page, you can see how many times a layer has been viewed, and its average user rating. Selecting on the layer’s title will take you to the information page where you can download the layer, edit metadata, or view additional information about the layer.

**Browsing Maps** - Click on the Maps link on the Boundless Exchange toolbar to open the Maps page. Like the Layers page, the Maps page lets you browse the available maps that have been uploaded into Exchange. The map’s rating and the number of times it has been viewed are available on this page. Similar to a layer, selecting on the title of a map will take you to its information page.

**Filtering** - Layers, maps and documents can be filtered to help you better manage the data available in Exchange. Listed below are several options to refine your search results.

   * **Filter by Text** - Filters results using basic search terms.

   * **Filter by Type (layers and documents)** - You can filter layers by raster, vector and WMS. Documents can be sorted by text, image or presentation.

   * **Filter by Category** - When the metadata for a layer or a map has been tagged with a specific category, it will be reflected in the Categories panel. Clicking on a category limits the layer list to those tagged with that category title. Selecting another category expands your results to include those layers in the results list. Clicking on the category a second time will remove it from the layer list.

   * **Filter by Keywords** - If a map, document or layer has been tagged with keywords, they will display under the Keywords section. Selecting on a keyword will filter your results to only those products containing those keywords in the metadata. You can select multiple keywords for better results.

   * **Filter by Owners** - You can select data based on the owner of the product. This may be useful if you are trying to quickly find products created by individuals on a joint project.

   * **Filter by Date** - This will limit the list of products by a date range. In the Date panel, select the start date and the end date for the date range. The list will update to reflect those layers, documents or maps created within that timeframe.
