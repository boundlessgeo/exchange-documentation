Working with Documents
======================

Uploading documents into Exchange allows you to share them with other users. Documents can be actual files, or they can be links to documents on other websites. You can associate a document to a layer or a map, which will display in the information page.

Uploading Documents
-------------------

1. Select the :guilabel:`Data` link on the Exchange toolbar, and click **Upload Document** in the drop-down menu.

  .. important:: Your Site Administrators may limit specific file types.

2. Add a title to the document as you would like it to appear in Exchange. It could be the same as the file name, but it doesn't have to be.

3. Select the :guilabel:`Choose File` button, and browse to the file to upload.

**OR:** Enter the URL for an existing document.

Setting Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The social design of Exchange allows users to coordinate on projects by sharing access to the same data; however, there may be instances when you want to limit who has what access to your documents. In Exchange, you can establish permissions for who can view, edit, and manage documents. Permissions can also be set for editing metadata.

5. On the right side of the page, under the **Who can view** and **Who can download** sections, add the name(s) of registered users or groups. This will ensure anonymous view access is disabled, and only those registered users specified are able to see your documents.

Select the checkbox next to **Anyone** to leave viewing or downloading available to all users.

6. In the same area, under **Who can download it?**, add the users or groups who have permission to download the document.

7. Set permissions for who is able to change metadata and manage the document accordingly.

8. Click the :guilabel:`Upload` button.

Enter the document’s metadata on the next page. It’s recommended that you enter an Abstract at a minimum. Metadata helps other users know more about what you are uploading, and why.

9. Fill out as much of the metadata as you can, or as needed.

10. When you have finished entering metadata, click the :guilabel:`Update` button at the bottom of the page.

The document will now be listed as an available result under the Explore Documents page.
