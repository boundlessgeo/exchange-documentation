Working with Documents
======================

Uploading documents into Exchange allows you to share them with other users. Documents can be actual files, or they can be links to other web sites of documents that are already online. You are able to associate a document to a layer or a map, which will display in the information page.

Uploading Documents
-------------------

To upload a document complete the following steps:

1. In the documents page, click on the :guilabel:`Upload Documents` button. The following file types can be uploaded as documents.

   .. important:: Your Site Administrators may limit specific file types.

2. Add a title to the document as you would like it to appear in Exchange. It could be the same as the file name, but it's not required.

3. Select the :guilabel:`Choose File` button, and browse to the file to upload, or enter the URL for an existing document.

6. Click the :guilabel:`Upload` button.

Enter the document’s metadata on the next page. It’s recommended that you enter an Abstract at a minimum. Metadata helps other users know more about what you are uploading, and why.

7. Fill out as much of the metadata as you can, or as needed.

8. When you have finished entering metadata, click the :guilabel:`Update` button at the bottom of the page.

The document will now be listed as an available result under the Explore Documents page.
