  .. figure:: img/change-code.png

To delete the signup code, click the :guilabel:`Delete` button, and select **Yes, I’m sure** to verify your choice.

Actstream (Activity Stream)
---------------------------

Actions
*******

Exchange uses Django Activity Stream, which creates a list of activities generated by the actions on your site, and allows you to quickly visualize who is performing what actions. An action is a description of an action that was performed (Verb) at some instance in time by some Actor on some optional Target that results in an Action Object getting created/updated/deleted.

Action events are categorized by four main components.

  * Actor - The user who performed the activity.
  * Verb - The verb phrase that identifies the action of the activity, such as created or deleted.
  * Action Object - The object linked to the action itself, such as a layer or a map.
  * Target - The object to which the activity was performed. Currently, Exchange is not using this component.

For example: admin (actor) uploaded (verb) a layer (object) 12 hours ago.

1. Click Actions in the Actstream menu on the Django site administration page.

  .. figure:: img/actstream.png

All of the actions that have taken place within Exchange will be listed, along with who performed it (actor), and what they did (verb). The target and whether or not the action is public is also listed, but they are not used at this time.

2. Click on an action to view more details.

  .. figure:: img/actions.png

Audit trail
-----------

The audit trail is intended to display all of the activities that happen within Exchange. It tracks who performed what actions, and when. Included is detailed information about the user, such as their IP, email address, full name and their user status.

To view the audit trail, click Audit events in the Audit trail menu on the Django site administration page.

  .. figure:: img/audit-trail.png

A list of all of the events that have occurred within Exchange will display. From here, administrators can filter everything for specific types of events, users, etc. using the search field. Simply type a term in the textbox, and click the Search button.

  .. figure:: img/audit-search.png

Audit trail is very similar to the Activity stream feature, but the primary difference is that with Audit trail, you are able to see when an event occurred, and from where. Activity stream tells you exactly what action has taken place.

Announcements
-------------

Administrators can create short messages for all Exchange users that will be placed at the top of their screen. Their importance level, determined by the originator, can range from general to critical, and can easily be scheduled for publication.

Create an announcement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Click the green plus (+) Add button next to Announcements.

  .. figure:: img/announcements.png

2. Provide a title for your message, and select the level of importance for your message from the Level list. Your options are General, Warning and Critical, and should be determined by the nature of the announcement.

3. Type your full message in the Content textbox.

4. Select the checkboxes to determine whether or not you’d like your announcement to be seen site-wide, and/or for Exchange members only.

  .. figure:: img/announcement-top.png

5. Use the publish start and end options to create a display time limit for your message, and select a dismissal option from the menu.

  .. figure:: img/announcement-bottom.png

6. Click the :guilabel:`Save` button to create your announcement. To verify your announcement is correct, click the View on site button in the upper right corner.

Add a new avatar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Click the green (+)  Add button in the Avatar menu on the Django administration page.

  .. figure:: img/avatar.png

  .. figure:: img/groups.png

Create a group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Click the **Add** link next to Group profiles on the Django Administration site Groups menu to open the Add group profile page.

2. Provide a unique title for your group. This will also be what is used for the Slug field. The Slug is a unique identifier for your group. If your group title is comprised of multiple words, you will need to use a hyphen or an underscore to replace the spaces.

  .. figure:: img/slug.png

    A slug is the URL friendly version of the title. For example, with the group We Love Maps, the slug would be either We-Love-Maps or We_Love_Maps. When the URL for the group is created, it becomes something like this:
http:// www.exchange.com/groups/groups/We-Love-Maps.

3. Browse to an image you want to use as a logo for the group.

4. Provide a brief description of the group. Explain briefly why the group was created, who the members are, or what service the group provides.

Working with Registry
---------------------

In Exchange, there are two primary types of data that can be added to Registry, a service or a single layer. A service is two or more layers being added to the map at the same time, whereas a single layer is just an individual layer. The form is the same for either one, but you will need to have a relatively good understanding of your data in order to successfully insert your new record.

Currently, you can add the following services in Exchange:

  * WMS - Web Map Service
  * MapServer - ESRI Map Service
  * ImageServer - ESRI Image Service

Add an individual record to CSW
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Exchange users with administrator privileges are able to add `CSW <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat>`_ records through their Exchange webpage.

1. Click on your user name in the toolbar. Select **Registry** from the drop-down menu to open the record form.

  .. figure:: img/registry-menu.png

2. A list of all items registered in Exchange will open, displaying their status as Complete, Unknown, Pending, or Error. Click the :guilabel:`Register a new Record` button in the top right corner to add a new record.

  .. figure:: img/registered-items.png

Click the :guilabel:`Register a new Record` button in the top right corner to add a new record.

3. Complete the form with all of the necessary information.

**Service URL** - This is the URL address for the endpoint you are trying to add.

  *ESRI MapServer Example:*
    *https://ngamaps.geointapps.org/arcgis/rest/services/Hurricane_Matthew/Bahamas_Latest_Damage_Assessments/MapServer*

**Note:** Entering a MapServer url will auto-populate the available services such as WMSServer, WFSServer, FeatureServer.

  *ESRI MapServer WMSserver Example:*
    *https://ngamaps.geointapps.org/arcgis/services/Hurricane_Matthew/Haiti_Latest_Assessments/MapServer/wmsserver*

  *ESRI ImageServer Example:*
    *https://gis.ngdc.noaa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/bag_hillshades/ImageServer*

**Title** - This field should populate automatically. The title should be related to the data, but should also be unique enough to find when performing a search. You can change the title if you don’t want what auto-filled.

**Layer Identifier** - For ESRI MapServer Services, this field will be populated automatically; however, for any other service type, the name of the layer is required for this field.

**Category** - Select a category from the list that best describes your data.

**Abstract** - The abstract should provide a brief description of the data being added.

**Agency** - Where did the information come from? This should also auto-populate. If Exchange is unable to detect who the data belongs to from the endpoint, add  the creator/agency information.

**Contact Email** - Please add your email address here.

**Contact Phone** - Please add a contact phone number here.

**Gold** -  Select this checkbox if the data is NGA-approved content.

  .. figure:: img/register-record.png

      This is an *example* of a completed new record form.

Additional services types (also called references) can be added by selecting the type from the drop down menu, and adding the URL. Service types discovered from the service URL are also listed at the top of the form.

  .. figure:: img/add-types.png

4. Click the :guilabel:`Submit Record` button to nominate record.

**Note:** Contact your Exchange administrator if the status does not display as Complete. They will need to take a look at your record via Django administration. Please see step 5 in the record administration section below.

For additional examples of records that have been successfully added in Exchange, please check out the Appendix.

Verify the record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you submit your record, you will be directed to the Registered Items page. To verify the record status in Registry, you can search for it using the Exchange search field at the top of the page, or use the Add Layer function from your map.

CSW Record Administration
-------------------------

Add a CSW record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Records can also be added through the Django administration site. The form there requires you to add all data manually, and does not have an auto-populate function.

**Agency -** Where did the information come from?

**Record Type -** The type field denotes what kind of data is being added.

For the services listed below, you would use the following information:

* ESRI map server - ESRI:ArcGIS:MapServer
* ESRI image server - ESRI:ArcGIS:ImageServer
* WMS Services - dataset

**Alternative -** An ESRI service will number each of the layers (starting with zero), and when adding data from a service, the alternative field points to the id individual layer to be pulled from that server. For GeoServer OGC services, the value for the Alternative field can be pulled from the layer name which is a string that does not contain spaces. If you leave the space blank, all of the associated layers will be added.

  .. figure:: img/mapserver.png

    List of layers with ID’s for the MapServer. The layer ID for Bridge Out is ‘1’ as indicated by the value in the parenthesis.

  .. figure:: img/geoserver.png

    Geoserver typically follows the format of <workspace>:<name>. The <name> portion is all that’s needed for the Alternative field.

**Relation -** This field is not currently used. It is used to associate records to one another

**Record Format -** This can vary depending on the kind of data being added. When registering a WMS service, format must be set to OGC:WMS.

  .. figure:: img/csw-status-msg.png

**Bounding Box coordinates: Upper Corner -** The bounding box defaults to an area that will cover what is being added. It is recommended to leave the default settings (85.0 180, -85.0 -180) unless you have specific requirements.

**Bounding Box: Lower Corner -** Same as above.

**Contact Email -** Please add your email address here.

Add chapters
************

The content of the story will be chapters made from maps and layers previously uploaded into Exchange.

**Note:** It is recommended that you add layers via the Map Interface to ensure all of the required fields are properly completed.

This form is nearly identical to the one used for creating your story.

1. Select a map from the StoryChapter object list, and type a “0” in the Chapter Index box to indicate this will be part of the first chapter. The available maps will correspond to the maps in Exchange.

**Note:** The first chapter of the story must begin with 0.

You can add additional layers to a chapter by repeating this step, and ensuring the chapter index is the same for all layers in a chapter. Create new chapters by changing the chapter index number.

2. Click the Edit (pencil icon) next to the map name to make any necessary edits to the metadata. Save

3. When you’ve finished adding all of your chapters, and they are in the desired sequential order, click the :guilabel:`Save` button.

If you marked the “Is Published” checkbox, your story will now be available for other users to view in Exchange. Users can search for your story through the Exchange search on the homepage, or filter for it based on any of the keywords you selected.
