Accounts and Users
==================

Exchange is a social platform, and thus a primary component of any Exchange instance is the user account.

Creating a New Account
----------------------

Depending on how the Exchange instance was configured, you may have to register for an account. If the :guilabel:`Register` link is not displayed, then you will need to contact the Site Systems Administrator to have an account created.

If the :guilabel:`Register` link is displayed then register a new account by completing the following steps:

#. Select the :guilabel:`Register` link and fill out all fields in the following form.

#. Depending on how the Exchange Site was configured you may have to confirm your email. If this is the case, follow the steps listed in the instructional email you will receive.

Managing Your Profile
---------------------

Your profile in Exchange is where you can add your points of contact, interests, and other related content you may want to publish. This is how other users will find you, and view your work.

To adjust your profile settings complete the following steps:

1. Click on your user name in the top right of the screen. Select :guilabel:`Profile` from the drop-down menu to enter the Profile Settings page. This will display your current profile settings..

2. To modify your profile, select the :guilabel:`Edit Profile` link.

3. On this page, you can update your information, including your avatar. It is important to include (at a minimum) your **First name**, **Last name** and **Email address**. This is required to properly display history of GeoGig versioned layers.

Viewing Other User Accounts
---------------------------

Once your account is created in Exchange, you will be able to view other user accounts on the system. This will let you see who else may be interested in the projects you are working on, or help you find additional data through collaboration.

1. Select the :guilabel:`About` link on the Exchange toolbar, and click **People** in the drop-down menu. You will see a list of thumbnails for all users registered on this system. Avatar images will display if the user has provided one.
