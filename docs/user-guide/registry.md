## Registry

Registry is a system for building, maintaining, and deploying a public registry of web map services of various types, OGC and Esri services. From a user's perspective, registry integration is within the mapping client. Rather than having to add multiple services into exchange, registry exposes external services and allows the user to add them to their map.

### Search the registry for a layer

#### Create a new map

Registry layers can be added to an existing map, but this example demonstrates how to create a new map, and add a registry layer.

1. To create a new map select Maps on the Boundless Exchange toolbar at the top of the page.

    You can filter the layer results by time using either the text boxes or the slide bar.


4. Type a year in the From text box to select a starting time. Then type a year in the To text box to select an end year. Years containing data are represented in the bar graph.

    You can also click and drag the points on the slide bar to select From and To dates.

5. Click the ![search](img/registry/search.png) button to submit your search, or the ![reset](img/registry/reset.png) button to clear your search terms.

Your search results will display in a new window.

### Add a layer from the registry to the map

Once you have search results from the registry, you can select specific layers to add to your map.

1. Hover your mouse over a layer in the results list. Additional information about the layer will display in the window near the results list.

3. Select the ![add-results](img/registry/add-results.png) button to add the layer to your map.
