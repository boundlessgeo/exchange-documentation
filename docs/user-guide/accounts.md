## Accounts and Users
---
Exchange is a social platform, and thus a primary component of any Exchange instance is the user account.

### Creating a New Account
---
Depending on how the Exchange instance was configured, you may have to register for an account. If the ![register-link](img/accounts/register-link.png) link is not displayed, then you will need to contact the Site Systems Administrator to have an account created.

If the ![register-link](img/accounts/register-link.png) link is displayed then register a new account by completing the following steps:

1. Select the ![register-link](img/accounts/register-link.png) link and fill out all fields in the following form.

2. Depending on how the Exchange Site was configured you may have to confirm your email. If that is the case follow the steps listed in the email once it is received.

### Managing Your Profile
---
Your profile is your Exchange page that describes your point of contacts, interests, and other related content you may want to publish.

To adjust your profile settings complete the following steps:

1. Select on your user name in the top right of the screen. A drop-down list will show. Click on ![profile-link](img/accounts/profile-link.png) to enter the Profile Settings page. This will display the current profile settings.

2. To adjust the settings, select the ![edit-profile-link](img/accounts/edit-profile-link.png) link.

3. On this page, you can update your information, including your avatar. It is __important__ to ensure you have at a minimum your __First name__, __Last name__ and __Email address__. This is required for proper displaying of history from GeoGig versioned layers.
