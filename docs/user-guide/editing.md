## Editing and Version Management

### Edit Features
Vector layers can be set up so that theyâ€™re editable. If you have permissions to edit a layer, the editing tools will be available in the map. If a layer is a GeoGit layer, then you can work with the edit history as well.

####Add a simple point feature to a layer
A layer that is able to be edited will have the __Add Feature__ ![add-feature-button](img/editing/add-feature-button.png) button available.

###Version Management
GeoGit is a specialized database that was designed for distributed editing and supports collaborative editing of geospatial data. It is designed for vector data (point, line, polygon, etc.). When a layer has been stored in GeoGit, it maintains the history of all of the changes made to the data along with who made the changes and when. Within the web map, you can view the history for a layer and for the features.

####GeoGig tab in Boundless Exchange
GeoGit layers in Boundless Exchange will have a GeoGig tab in addition to the other tabs on the Layer detail page. The history is a list of commits that have been made to the layer.

1. In the Layer detail page, click on the GeoGig tab to see the chronological list of commits.

    ![history-geogig-tab](img/editing/history-geogig-tab.png)

      _Commit history within the GeoGig tab_

2. In order to search through the commit history, type in the search box in the __GeoGig__ tab. You can search for any value in the commit history.

####View layer history
You can view a layer's history from the map.

1. Click the name of the layer you want to view. The menu will expand to show additional layer options.

2. Click on the Show History button. The history will expand.

    ![show-layer-history](img/editing/show-layer-history.png)

3. To view details about a commit, hover over it with the mouse. The color bar next to the commit indicates the type of edits that were made. Green indicates a new feature was added. Yellow indicates a feature was modified. Red indicates a feature was deleted. A commit can have multiple types of edits. In such cases, the bar will have colors representative of the types of edits that were made.

    ![layer-history](img/editing/layer-history.png)

    _History detail for a commit_

4. Click on a commit, and its history will update to show the individual edits within that commit. MapLoom will make one commit per edit. The Arbiter mobile app can upload many edits as one commit.

    ![summary-of-changes](img/editing/summary-of-changes.png)

5. Click the __Show Changes__ button to bring up a new window, displaying the specific changes that were made. The changes will be highlighted with the same color coding as the commits. Green means something was added. Yellow means the feature was changed. Red means the feature was deleted. In the image below, the feature was added, and so the feature on the map is highlighted in green.

    ![show-feature-edits](img/editing/show-feature-edits.png)

####View feature history
In addition to viewing the history of edits on a GeoGit layer, you can also view the history of a feature.

1. Click a feature on the map. The feature details will appear.

2. Click on the __Show History__ button. The history list will expand with the commits that contain changes for that feature.

    ![view-feature-history](img/editing/view-feature-history.png)

3. Click on the specific commit you want to view details for. The history will update to show the edits made to the feature for that commit.

    ![list-commit-edits](img/editing/list-commit-edits.png)

4. Click the __Show Changes__ button to bring up a new window, displaying the specific changes that were made. The changes will be highlighted with the same color coding as the commits. Green means something was added. Yellow means the feature was changed. Red means the feature was deleted. In the image below, the feature was added, and so the feature on the map is highlighted in green.

    ![show-authors](img/editing/show-authors.png)

5. Click on the Show Authors button to see the names and dates for every attribute in the feature. Note that through the lifetime of a feature, there can be several authors. This is a good way to see who has contributed to a featureâ€™s current state.
