## Working with Documents
---
You can upload documents to Exchange so that they’re readily available for users. Documents can be actual files or links to other documents online. You can also associate a document to a layer or a map.

### Uploading Documents

To upload a document complete the following steps:

1. In the documents page, click on the ![upload-documents-button](img/documents/upload-documents-button.png) button.

    __Note:__ _Your Site Administrators may limit specific file types, typically the following file types are able to be uploaded._

    ![url-upload](img/documents/url-upload.png)

4. If you want to link the document to a map or a layer, choose it in the Link to section

5. Set permissions for who is able to view and manage the document accordingly

6. Click on the ![upload](img/documents/upload.png) button

9. The document will now be listed as a possible result under the Documents page..
